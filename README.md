# Star Wars Genesis V4: Total Conversion Modlist for Starfield
![Starfield Modlist Photoshop Cropped](https://github.com/DeityVengy/Star_Wars_Genesis_V2_for_Starfield_1.11.36/assets/170469610/7473f5e6-41f7-44e2-add5-3561df29b1be)

This is a guide on installing the Star Wars Genesis modlist that turns Starfield into Star Wars, as seen on YouTube and featured on IGN.<br />
THIS IS THE BETA VERSION OF V4. IF YOU'RE READING THIS, INSTALL AT YOUR OWN RISK


## **Overview:**<br />
- Complete Sound and Music Overhaul<br />
- Full Conversion of ALL Factions<br />
- Full Conversion of ALL Weapons<br />
- Full Conversion of ALL Spacesuits<br />
- Notable Locations, Planets, and Dialogue Rewritten<br />
- Star Wars Aliens<br />
- Star Wars Misc Items<br />
- Star Wars Signs, Wallpapers, Logos, and other Textures<br />
- Third Person Combat Revamped<br />
- Gameplay Enhancements and Bug Fixes<br />
- Immersive Starting Experience<br />
- 4k Textures<br />
- Realistic Damage, Balancing, and Scaling<br />
- Alternate Start<br />

## **Requirements:**
1. Decent Gaming PC. Make sure unmodded Starfield alone runs fine on your PC before attempting these mods. If you're lagging after installing these mods with a budget build, you can disable the HD Overhaul to alleviate it.
2. Steam version of Starfield. Alot of these mods have posts about people having issues installing it on the GamePass and MS Store version and some of them straight up aren't compatible. You are completely on your own unfortunately if you choose to go through it knowing this
3. Mod Organizer 2.5.0. I cannot recommend Vortex. You WILL have issues and you will either notice them straight away or you will NOT notice them until it's too late. For example, there was a user that got this modlist "perfecty" working on Vortex. Afer a few hours, he ran into infinite loading screens on his fresh save. Please just respect your time and sanity and just take the extra 5-10 minutes to install MO2 on your PC. You can download the latest release version of Mod Organizer 2 from [here](https://github.com/Modorganizer2/modorganizer/releases) and choose a portable install for Starfield.
4. Not a requirement but I highly recommend doing this on a fresh save for the most immersive and best experience. V3 now features an alternate start mod themed around this modlist. There will be some mods that won't work on an existing save but you can workaround it by looking at the FAQ.
5. Version 1.12.30 of Starfield. PLEASE TURN OFF AUTOMATIC UPDATES for your sake and don't update until I give the green light in my Discord. Bethesda is known for breaking mods in their updates and you may still have issues if you choose to downgrade.
6. DOUBLE CHECK THAT YOU TURNED OFF AUTOMATIC UPDATES FOR STARFIELD 

## **IMPORTANT PRE-STEPS**   <br />
1. Join this [discord](https://discord.gg/ewUVAqyrQX), get roles, and download the installer version of MO2 2.5.2 shown in #dev-builds. Point the install location to your MO2/Starfield folder. If done correctly, it should look like this on the top left your MO2 application: ![image](https://github.com/DeityVengy/Star_Wars_Genesis_V3_for_Starfield_1.12.30/assets/170469610/a295204a-a7ee-4273-b788-15abf1a65739)
2. In Mod Organizer 2, go to Tools, Settings, Plugins, and scroll down to Starfield Support Plugin. Set "bypass_plugins_enabler_check" to true. If it's already on true, just leave it be <br />
3. If you've modded Starfield at launch and/or with Vortex Mod Manager, your setup is probably a mess. Please uninstall Starfield completely (delete both Starfield folders in "My Games" and "steamapps\common" folder) and then install it again to delete any remnants of old mods. If you don't have it already, create a StarfieldCustom.ini at: " C:\Users\UserName\Documents\My Games\Starfield" AND "Starfield\profiles\Default" (your MO2 Directory). Download the StarfieldCustom.ini file from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1WaVrlGY144bWFqygE4MVmQcPbBng-eS7?usp=sharing) and replace the current ones <br />
4. When updating a mod in MO2, just download as you normally would and click "Replace". DO NOT "Merge".
5. If you're upgrading multiple versions of Genesis (for example V2 to V4), I would honestly suggest starting over or just going through each and every mod and make sure you're using the updated/correct version listed. I know it's not ideal but both Starfield and this modlist are in active development and there's lots of changes happening in the background.

## **Manually Installed Mods:**<br />
Please read each mod instruction carefully. They're manually installed in different places. <br />
1. Starfield Script Extender (V0.28) [link](https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/106?tab=files)  <br />
   Drag the contents of sfse_0_2_7 into steamapps\common\Starfield <br />
   Add SFSE to MO2 by following these instructions: [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWVri7somCI&t=85s)
2. Mandalorian Collection Mesh Texture Edits (v2): [link](https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/6043?tab=files)<br />
   Drag the CONTENTS of "Main- Install First" into Documents\My Games\Starfield\ <br />
   DO NOT just drag the actual "Main - Install First" folder inside your Data folder. This is a common mistake.
3. Starfield Hotkeys: [link](https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/1578?tab=files) <br />
   Put into steamapps\common\Starfield. Delete hotkeys.ini
4. Boostpack to Jetpack (A TRUE Jetpack Experience): [link](https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/3800?tab=files)<br />
   I did the Forever Jetpack option but feel free to do any of the other ones. Run enable_hotkeys.cmd after
5. Real ADS - Part 2 - Add Real Zoom: [link](https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/3939?tab=files)<br />
   Open the RealADS_Sniper folder. Drag RealADS.txt into steamapps\common\Starfield
6. Star Wars Mandalorian Title Screen Overhaul [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1xSbbV_F8L1KNOMc0d8S53sihKWz-2bt0?usp=sharing)  <br />
   Install Part 2 Only by putting the Data folder into steamapps\common\Starfield <br />
7. Starfield Performance Boost (All In One (For all)): [link](https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/290?tab=files) <br />
   Drag all the contents into steamapps\common\Starfield.

## **Mod Manager Modlist:** <br />
**Note: This is following the exact load order in Mod Organizer 2 from top to bottom. Ignore the mod's instructions and just follow mine. Do Mod Manager Install for all of these**<br />
**Note: All google drive links are still installed by Mod Organizer 2. Just drag the archive into the downloads section of MO2 and install as you normally would**<br />

**Please make sure you download the correct version shown in the parentheses.**

If you see this symbol anywhere in your load order or plugin order, that means something went wrong. ![image](https://github.com/DeityVengy/Star_Wars_Genesis_V4_for_Starfield_1.12.32/assets/170469610/7083f233-983c-43b9-93e1-c3d8ab7e2da4) This modlist should not having any missing masters. Please join my discord and I'll try to help you out

## **IN-GAME SETUP**<br />
1. If loading an existing save and a pop-up asking about load order appears, make sure you click CURRENT. Then, create a new manual save. Close and the game and check if any plugins on the right side unchecked themselves. If they did, check them and load the new manual save you created. If you close your game again, then the plugins shouldn't uncheck themselves (besides the SFBGS ones) `NEW TO V3`
2. If loading an existing save, you're going to see a popup as soon as you load in about SKK Fast Start and a STOP CODE. Just close it and don't worry about it.
3. If loading a new save, pick whether or not you want to be apart of constellation, your starting location, and your loadout. Then click done. Once you've loaded in and you see the new game pop-up, save and restart the game for some additional mods to automatically apply.
4. Make sure your difficulty settings are all on normal.
5. For every new jetpack you equip, you must press F1 to activate the jetpack mod. This will unequip your current jetpack so you will have to put the same jetpack on and then press F1 again
   
## **Common Problems and Questions**
1. How do I get the Mandalorian Armor?<br />
   It replaces the Mantis Armor. You can spawn the armor in with these console commands but just know the game will be easier than intended with it. It's an endgame unique armor that goes head to head with Celestial (Starborn) armor and the challenge to get it naturally takes some work now since it requires an Aurebesh translator: <br />

   player.additem 0016640A<br />
   player.additem 0016640B<br />
2. The game is crashing on startup/isn't launching. <br />
   I'm assuming you updated your game recently. Classic Bethesda issue. Delete starfield.exe in your steamapps folder and then verify your game files through Steam.
3. Why no lightsabers?<br />
   There are a few lightsaber and jedi/sith mods but it just doesn't really work or feel immersive, especially with this game's poor melee combat. I will add lightsabers when they are ready with proper animations, deflection, and dismemberment. To be fair, the odds of an average person in Star Wars encountering  Jedi/Sith is pretty low anyway. Just make it part of your headcannon lol.
4. I see the Star Wars themed weapons but they don't fire lasers. How do I fix this?<br />
   Make sure all the Weapon Replacer mods are BELOW the Armor mods and overwrite them. Do the same for the esm files. This is a common problem I hear about often and if you're in this situation, that means you didn't follow the load order above at all. That is just one out of countless issues you're gonna have if you don't follow this load and plugin order.
5. I see "Lookup failed!" on some weapons and armor. How do I fix?<br />
   If you see this, that means one of your mods is probably the wrong version/outdated or your game is the wrong version/outdated. There's usually no other cause. This can also happen on Gamepass and MS Store versions of the game and I can't help you there.
6. Certain NPC's are missing their heads or aren't converted. How do I fix? <br />
   This happens when you mod existing saves. There are 2 possible solutions. Open console, click them, and do resetinventory. If that doesn't work, try using "disable" on them closing the console for them to disappear, and then open console and type enable. Highly recommend saving your game before hand incase you mess something up.
7. X Mod isn't working. What do i do? <br />
    Make sure you followed my load order. Make sure you installed the indicated version of every mod and not simply the updated version. Make sure you followed my plugin load order and that it is locked so Starfield doesn't reset it. Make sure your Starfield version is V1.12.30. Make sure you don't have any other mods that could possibly conflict and if you do, then you should be able to verify they don't conflict with SF1Edit. Make sure you're using Mod Organizer 2. Make sure you're using the Steam version of Starfield. If all those things are true/correct, then join my discord and I'll try to help you out.
8. Why are some of the mods on Google Drive and not on Nexus Mods? <br />
   Because Nexus Mods is unironically anti-mod. I need permission to modify and update people's files that have been inactive and abandoned for 6+ months. Their mod isn't working anymore. No one is downloading it. No one can contact the original owner. But for some reason I'm not allowed to fix it. I also understandably can't upload any mods with Star Wars music due to copyright, but in reality it's not like Disney would actually care... To be quite honest, I don't really care about any these rules and just want to make a proper Star Wars game/modlist. I allow all my mods be modified and reuploaded freely and I have multiple backups of all files in this modlist so that Star Wars Genesis is never held hostage by deleted mods. I try my best to get permission from every single custom mod I do but there will be cases of miscommunication/disagreement so if any mod author feels that I've stolen their Star Wars asset, feel free to DM me on Discord and we can work things out. If your mod is well-made, I don't mind buying the rights to modify it like I've done with Akasyan's Neocrusader mod.
