This is a guide on installing the Star Wars Genesis modlist that turns Starfield into Star Wars, as seen on YouTube and featured on IGN.<br />


## **Overview:**<br />

- Full Conversion of ALL Weapons<br />
- Full Conversion of ALL Spacesuits<br />
- Notable Locations, Planets, Items, and Dialogue Rewritten<br />

- POI & Worldgen Revamp<br />
- Dynamic Weather <br />
- Active War Between Empire & Rebels
- Automated Install

## **Requirements:**
1.  Nonpirated **_Steam_** version of Starfield. Alot of these mods have posts about people having issues installing it on the GamePass and MS Store version and some of them straight up aren't compatible. You are completely on your own unfortunately if you choose to go through it knowing this. Nothing against pirating tbh but Wabbajack won't work on pirated game installs since they do an integrity check and the pirated version is always a few patches behind. So please don't waste my time asking for help because it's a lost cause.
2. Version 1.12.36 of Starfield. PLEASE TURN OFF AUTOMATIC UPDATES for your sake and don't ever update until a newer version of Star Wars Genesis releases. Bethesda is known for breaking mods in their updates and you may still have issues if you choose to downgrade.
3. DOUBLE CHECK THAT YOU TURNED OFF AUTOMATIC UPDATES FOR STARFIELD

4. No creation store mods installed. Disable/Uninstall them all first. Please DO NOT keep them enabled after reading this and then ask for help in my Discord after you experience an obscure bug that is most probably caused by their conflict. Known issues range from your game completely not starting to crashes and other issues.
5. Decent Gaming PC. Make sure unmodded Starfield alone runs fine on your PC before attempting these mods. If you're lagging after installing these mods with a budget build, you can disable the optional HD Overhaul to alleviate it.
6. Not a requirement but I highly recommend doing this on a fresh save for the most immersive and best experience. Common issues include existing NPC's keeping their existing armor/weapons, existing planets you've landed on not being revamped, and your health being the wrong value.
7. Windows 10 or 11 (Mod Organizer 2 Limitation)
8. Atleast 50 GB of available space (200+ GB if planning on using HD Overhaul), preferably on an SSD

## **What is Wabbajack?**<br />
Wabbajack is an automated modlist installer. It will replicate my modlist and all it's configurations with a portable version of Mod Organizer 2 on your PC. If you have premium on Nexus Mods, then this process is very easy and in just a few clicks, you can be downloading hundreds of mods at once. If you don't have premium, it's going to have you click through each mod to download but it'll guide you exactly on which one to click. After that, it'll still do all the load order/plugin configuration for you.


## **IMPORTANT PRE-STEPS**   <br />
1. If you've modded Starfield at launch and/or with Vortex Mod Manager, your setup and save is probably a mess. Please uninstall Starfield through Steam and then double checking that both **_Documents\My Games\Starfield_** and **_steamapps\common\Starfield_** folders are deleted <br />

## **Wabbajack Install**   <br />

1. Download [Star Wars Genesis Wabbajack Compiler](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1R1jPw3mKwdUfeNr4dWaPMiswpZsLL1sD/view?usp=drive_link) and put it on your Desktop.
2. Download the latest version of Wabbajack from [here](https://www.wabbajack.org/) and put it in a folder called **_Wabbajack_**, then install.
3. Create a folder called **_Star Wars Genesis_** in the location where you want to install everything (AWAY FROM WABBAJACK INSTALL LOCATION).
4. MAKE SURE you did not mix the Wabbajack install folder with the Star Wars Genesis folder. These cannot be inside each other. The Star Wars Genesis.wabbajack file cannot be inside the Star Wars Genesis folder too. Everything should be on the same drive, including the wabbajack file.
5. Open Wabbajack.exe for the first time and click the gear icon (settings) on the top left, then logon to Nexus Mods.
6. Close Wabbajack and double click the _Star Wars Genesis.wabbajack_ file you downloaded earlier
7. Set the "_Modlist Installation Location_" to the _**Star Wars Genesis**_ folder you created earlier. The Resource Downlaod folder should auto-fill. Leave that alone.
8. Start the install. if you don't have Nexus Premium, then Wabbajack makes you click through each mod. if you do have Nexus Premium, then Wabbajack downloads each mod automatically for you.<br />
9. If at any point your install gets "stuck", just close wabbajack and start the install again, pointing to the same location you chose earlier and unchecking the "overwrite" option. This will resume where you left off. A "stuck" install is different from an error. If you get an error, don't bother trying to reinstall as the problem is due to something else
9. Once the install is finished, launch **ModOrganizer.exe** in the _**Star Wars Genesis**_ folder. This is how you will always start the game from now on. DO NOT just type Mod Organizer in your Windows search bar next time and open another MO2 install lol.<br />
_Note: I must re-iterate. DO NOT put the wabbajack file from step 1 into the Star Wars Genesis folder and try to install that way. Your install will fail._

## **IMPORTANT POST-STEP** <br />
0. If this is a fresh install of Starfield and you've never played it before, launch the game through Steam atleast once. Then close it.
1. Go to Documents\My Games\Starfield and place the [StarfieldCustom.ini](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Sy_oYuMoBkWTvWZTWLl5GE7eNywmoHGA/view?usp=drive_link) file in there

## **Mod Manager Modlist** <br />
### <br />**HD Overhaul (OPTIONAL)**<br />
[This](https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/5124?tab=files) amounts to 100+ GB of 2-4K textures and will lead to performance issues if you have a weak PC. 
MANUALLY DOWNLOAD these files and then put their archives in the Star Wars Genesis\Downloads folder. DO NOT download directly through MO2 as it's prone to get issues this way. Refresh the Downloads tab on the right side of MO2's UI, scroll all the way down, and right click + install each mod.
1. Download and install all available parts and make sure you name them the correct part number when installing (Ex. Part 1, Part 2, etc)
2. Download and install HD Overhaul Textures Patch
3. Download and install Starfield HD Overhaul ESM<br />
Now place all these mods in the HD Overhaul category like so and check them: <br />
![image](https://github.com/DeityVengy/Star-Wars-Genesis-V4-Wabbajack/assets/170469610/5e93ac36-ee7d-43a2-8b66-10215287cd82) <br />
The final step is to go to steamapps\common\Starfield and place this [file](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1c09DG3dXQqGIUtGkRNBq3jV5x-ROaSpj/view?usp=drive_link) in there.

### <br />**Sound (IMPORTANT)**<br />
1. Download [Star Wars Music and Ambience Overhaul](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YlhFBB024oBvKIl1q7q6oYUZrnuCORoY/view?usp=drive_link)
   The archive (unextracted) goes into the Star Wars Genesis\Downloads folder. Refresh the Downloads tab on the right side of MO2's UI, scroll all the way down, and right click + install the mod. Name the mod "Star Wars Music and Ambience Overhaul (Non-Combat)" without the quotation marks. Then choose the **_replace_** option when installing. Now you can check the box on the left side to enable the mod <br />
   #### _Note: The Red Triangles you see in the downloads tab is nothing to worry about._<br />
   If you don't hear Star Wars Music while walking around cities/planets, then you installed this wrong.
   
## **IN-GAME SETUP** (DO NOT SKIP THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT)<br />
Now you are ready to launch the game. You may click the RUN button at the top right of Mod Organizer 2 and follow the next few steps. PLEASE DO NOT PANIC if it takes awhile to start for the first time.

### **STARTING A NEW SAVE**
1. After creating your character, save your game and then restart and load that same save to fix the sound issue (and numerous other issues).
   
### **LOADING AN EXISTING SAVE**
1. If a pop-up asking about load order appears, make sure you click CURRENT
2. If a warning pops up saying x plugin is missing, do NOT search for it in the creations menu and CONTINUE loading without it. These are redundant plugins that have been integrated into Star Wars Genesis
3. If you see a popup as soon as you load in about SKK Fast Start and a STOP CODE. Just close it and don't worry about it.
4. Check how much HP your character has under the _Status_ menu. If you're level 1, you should have 100 HP. If you're level 50, you should have around 150 hp, etc. If you're missing HP (for example someone went from v3 to v4 and only had 13 hp), then you must cheat your health back to normal with this command:<br />
   _player.modav health x_ <br />
   X being the number of health you want to add to your character. If you have 13 hp and are level 50, then you do _player.modav health 137_ to reach 150 intended health.

### **ALL SAVES**
1. Your graphics preset most probably reset back to _Low_, which explains why your game is ugly. Go to settings and change it if you wish. My recommended settings are:
   - Motion Blur Off
   - VSync Off
   - Upscaling Off (unless you really need it)
   - Everything else on Ultra (if you can)
   - Show Damage Numbers OFF under Interface
   - Dialogue and General Subtitles ON under Accessibility
2. Music is off by default for some reason. Highly recommend turning that above "0" so you can hear the amazing soundtrack
3. Make sure your difficulty settings are all on normal.
4. For every new jetpack you equip, you must press F1 to activate the jetpack mod. This will unequip your current jetpack so you will have to equip the jetpack again and then press F1 again
5. Going to mention it one more time here. Disable automatic updates for Starfieldon Steam

## Difficulty (Optional)
- If you're finding the game too hard (especially in the beginning), you can increase your health by 50 or 100 with console commands to make it more doable. The command for that is: **_player.modav health 100_**<br />
- If you're finding the game too easy after leveling up and getting proper armor/weapons, you can revert that above change by running this command: **_player.modav health -100_**

## **F.A.Q.**
Technical Support F.A.Q. can be found [here](https://github.com/DeityVengy/Star-Wars-Genesis-FAQ) <br />
The rest are general questions:
### Xbox Version? <br />
   I will personally not be making an Xbox version simply due to me not having an Xbox to test it on myself and large group of mods in this list (the packs, sfse mods, root mods, etc), all not being possible on Xbox. My mods on Nexus are all open permission and free to be ported over by others though, and I've noticed some already have been. You can get something similar on Xbox but not to this level unfortuantely, atleast for awhile.
### How do I get X Weapon/Armor?<br />
   Every single thing in this modlist can be acquired ingame through natural progression. If you want to skip that, then download the Star Wars Genesis Encyclopedia in my Discord and find the base game equivalent of the Weapon/Armor you want. Google the ID of that item and spawn it in with console commands. I DO NOT SUPPORT ANYTHING IN THE WORKBENCHES. You are free to use stuff in the workbenches but they are not balanced around Star Wars Genesis and may even be buggy.
### Why no lightsabers?<br />
   There are a few lightsaber and jedi/sith mods but it just doesn't really work or feel immersive, especially with this game's poor melee combat. I will add lightsabers when they are ready with proper animations, deflection, and dismemberment. To be fair, the odds of an average person in Star Wars encountering Jedi/Sith is pretty low anyway. Just make it part of your headcannon lol.
### Are there any ship mods in this modlist?<br />
   Not yet. Since those mods require you to install them with a video guide, I find them pointless to include since 90% of people won't know about it due to the nature of this "plug and play" modlist. I'm waiting for actual ship replacers.
