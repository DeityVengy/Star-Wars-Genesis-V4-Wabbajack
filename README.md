This is a guide on installing the Star Wars Genesis modlist that turns Starfield into Star Wars, as seen on YouTube and featured on IGN.<br />
THIS IS THE BETA VERSION OF V4. IF YOU'RE READING THIS, INSTALL AT YOUR OWN RISK


## **Overview:**<br />
- Complete Sound and Music Overhaul<br />
- Full Conversion of ALL Factions<br />
- Full Conversion of ALL Weapons<br />
- Full Conversion of ALL Spacesuits<br />
- Notable Locations, Planets, and Dialogue Rewritten<br />
- Alien Races<br />
- Converted Cities & Misc Items<br />
- Aurebesh Wallpapers, Logos, and other Textures<br />
- Third Person Combat Revamped<br />
- Gameplay Enhancements and Bug Fixes<br />
- Immersive Alternate Start Experience<br />
- 4k Textures<br />
- Realistic Damage, Balancing, and Scaling<br />
- Rebalanced Economy <br />

## **Requirements:**
1.  Nonpirated **Steam** version of Starfield. Alot of these mods have posts about people having issues installing it on the GamePass and MS Store version and some of them straight up aren't compatible. You are completely on your own unfortunately if you choose to go through it knowing this. Nothing against pirating tbh but Wabbajack won't work on pirated game installs since they do an integrity check and the pirated version is always a few patches behind. So please don't waste my time asking for help because it's a lost cause.
2. Version 1.12.32 of Starfield. PLEASE TURN OFF AUTOMATIC UPDATES for your sake and don't ever update until a newer version of Star Wars Genesis releases. Bethesda is known for breaking mods in their updates and you may still have issues if you choose to downgrade.
3. DOUBLE CHECK THAT YOU TURNED OFF AUTOMATIC UPDATES FOR STARFIELD
4. Decent Gaming PC. Make sure unmodded Starfield alone runs fine on your PC before attempting these mods. If you're lagging after installing these mods with a budget build, you can disable the optional HD Overhaul to alleviate it.
5. Not a requirement but I highly recommend doing this on a fresh save for the most immersive and best experience. Common issues include existing NPC's keeping their existing armor/weapons, existing planets you've landed on not being revamped, and your health being the wrong value.
6. Windows 10/11 (Mod Organizer 2 Limitation)
7. Atleast 50 GB of available space (200+ GB if planning on using HD Overhaul), preferably on an SSD

## **What is Wabbajack?**<br />
Wabbajack is an automated modlist installer. It will replicate my modlist and all it's configurations with a portable version of Mod Organizer 2 on your PC. If you have premium on Nexus Mods, then this process is very easy and in just a few clicks, you can be downloading hundreds of mods at once. If you don't have premium, it's going to have you click through each mod to download but it'll guide you exactly on which one to click. After that, it'll still do all the load order/plugin configuration for you.


## **IMPORTANT PRE-STEPS**   <br />
1. If you've modded Starfield at launch and/or with Vortex Mod Manager, your setup is probably a mess. Please uninstall Starfield completely (delete both Starfield folders in "My Games" and "steamapps\common" folder) and then install it again to delete any remnants of old mods. <br />

## **Wabbajack Install**   <br />

1. Download Star Wars Genesis Wabbajack Compiler from here
2. Download and install the latest version of Wabbajack from [here](https://www.wabbajack.org/)
3. Create a folder called **_Star Wars Genesis_** in the location where you want to install everything (AWAY FROM WABBAJACK INSTALL LOCATION).
4. When you open Wabbajack for the first time, click the gear icon (settings) on the top left and logon to Nexus Mods
5. In the main menu, choose the "_Install From Disk_" option
6. Set your target modlist to the "_Star Wars Genesis Wabbajack Compiler_" you downloaded earlier
7. Set the "_Modlist Installation Location_" to the _**Star Wars Genesis**_ folder you created earlier.
8. Once the install is finished, launch **ModOrganizer.exe** in the _**Star Wars Genesis**_ folder

## **Mod Manager Modlist** <br />
<br />**HD Overhaul (OPTIONAL)**<br />
[This](https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/5124?tab=files) amounts to 100+ GB of 2-4K textures and will lead to performance issues if you have a weak PC. 
1. Download and install all available parts and make sure you name them the correct part number when installing (Ex. Part 1, Part 2, etc)
2. Download and install HD Overhaul Textures Patch
3. Download and install Starfield HD Overhaul ESM

<br />**Sound (IMPORTANT)**<br />
1. Download Star Wars Music and Ambience Overhaul from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YlhFBB024oBvKIl1q7q6oYUZrnuCORoY/view?usp=drive_link) and **replace** the empty mod when installing.

## **Plugin Load Order** <br />
1. Download plugins.txt and put it into Star Wars Genesis\profiles\Star Wars Genesis Compiler
2. In Mod Organizer 2, go to the plugins tab on the right and click this button![image](https://github.com/DeityVengy/Star-Wars-Genesis-V4-Wabbajack/assets/170469610/28a6f6fd-be15-4e60-bf82-5b356ab8ce4d)
3. Choose the top option that comes up

## **IN-GAME SETUP**<br />
Now you are ready to launch the game. You may click the RUN button at the top right of Mod Organizer 2 and follow the next few steps.

**LOADING AN EXISTING SAVE**
1. If a pop-up asking about load order appears, make sure you click CURRENT
2. If a warning pops up saying x plugin is missing, do NOT search for it in the creations menu and CONTINUE loading without it. These are redundant plugins that have been integrated into Star Wars Genesis
3. If you see a popup as soon as you load in about SKK Fast Start and a STOP CODE. Just close it and don't worry about it.
4. Check how much HP your character has. If you're level 1, you should have 100 HP. If you're level 50, you should have around 150 hp, etc. If you're missing HP (for example someone went from v3 to v4 and only had 13 hp), then you must cheat your health back to normal with this command: player.modav health x
   
**STARTING A NEW SAVE**
1. Make you you save and restart the game as soon as you load in to fix the sound issue (and numerous other issue)

**ALL SAVES**
1. Your graphics preset most probably reset back to _Low_, which explains why your game is ugly. Go to settings and change it if you wish.
2. Make sure your difficulty settings are all on normal.
3. For every new jetpack you equip, you must press F1 to activate the jetpack mod. This will unequip your current jetpack so you will have to equip the jetpack again and then press F1 again

## **Patch Notes (V3 to V4)**

**General**
- **Wabbajack support**
- Updated StarfieldCustom.ini file with better textures/display config
- KiLoader/Loose Root Data Implementation
- Removed 4 redundant plugins and integrated them into Genesis

**Gameplay**
- Better Weather System for ALL Planets
- Populated planets now have WAY more POI's while barren planets remain the same
- Removed and replaced integalactic loading screens with Hyperspace VFX Transitions
- Gravity Wave converted to proper Force Push
- Star Wars Background and Traits
- Terrifying Terrormorphs Revamp, converting them into Corrupted Rakghouls that inflict allies with Rakghoul plague, turning allies against you and making your character hear voices in their head. Variations include Dread Rakghouls, Phantom Rakghouls, Nightmare Rakghouls, and more.
- Added rare absorbable Kyber Crystals near planet landing areas. Every 3 you absorb gives you 1 skill point
- Added scattered Jedi/Sith Temple Ruins that reward you with unique force powers or status effects
- The Empire and the Rebels are now in active war. You will see them attack each other in Space.

**Spacesuits/Clothing**

- Shaw Gang renamed to Swoop Gang and given new armor
- The Ebbside Strikers are now Revanites
- Hondo Ohnaka is now The Collector. The Scow is renamed to Ohnaka Gang Base and it's NPCs are Ohnaka Gang members. The unique NPC's are wearing varied Bounty Hunter Armor
- The Shadow Collective has been mixed with the Hondo Ohnaka pirate mod. The grunts have been turned into pirates while the elites and unique NPC's have kept their Mandalorian armor
- "Prototype Sentinel Armor" replacer for new ETES spacesuit given at end of free tracker questline (still needs armor balancing tho)
- Replaced Nar Shaddaa Dancer with Princess Leia Slave Outfits and other Star Wars Aliens. This indirectly causes women wearing swimsuits at Niamos to be topless. Sorry not sorry

- Added skeletons to destroyed Taris
- Added large Dish above Mast Tower to make it look like Rogue One Citadel Tower
- Bigger Rocks/Trees

**Balancing**
- Lore Accurate Weapon Change Overhaul
- Darksaber will no longer be used or dropped by normal enemies and instead only by Yuuzhan Vong
- Bullet Sponges have indirectly been fixed due to downgrading Ascension to 1.4.5
- Removed the EM resist that Yuuzhan Vong NPC's naturally had (from Ascension)
- Fixed Shaw Gang bullet sponges and invisible heads
- Patched Ascension's poor weapon accuracy with good accuracy instead
- Continued Renaming Project Development

**Economy**

- Buildable Astromech Droids inside ship
- Lt. Torres and Captain Myeong now wear their correct faction's space armor during main quest

- Melee attacks and Force Powers no longer get cancelled in third person due to Quick Lowered Weapons
- You no longer flail while falling/using the Jetpack

## **Common Problems and Questions**
1. How do I get X Weapon/Armor?<br />
   Every single thing in this modlist can be acquired ingame through natural progression. If you want to skip that, then download the Star Wars Genesis Encyclopedia in my Discord and find the base game equivalent of the Weapon/Armor you want. Google the ID of that item and spawn it in with console commands. I DO NOT SUPPORT ANYTHING IN THE WORKBENCHES. You are free to use stuff in the workbenches but they are not balanced around Star Wars Genesis and may even be buggy.
2. The game is too hard and I'm getting one shot by everything <br />
   If you're finding the game too hard (especially in the beginning), you can increase your health by 50 or 100 with console commands to make it more doable. The command for that is **player.modav health 100**<br />
   If you're finding the game too easy after leveling up and getting proper armor/weapons, you can revert that change by running this command: **player.modav health -100**
4. The game is crashing on startup/isn't launching. <br />
   Delete starfield.exe in your steamapps folder and then verify your game files through Steam. You will have to reinstall Part 2 of the Title Screen Overhaul again (scroll up)
5. Why no lightsabers?<br />
   There are a few lightsaber and jedi/sith mods but it just doesn't really work or feel immersive, especially with this game's poor melee combat. I will add lightsabers when they are ready with proper animations, deflection, and dismemberment. To be fair, the odds of an average person in Star Wars encountering Jedi/Sith is pretty low anyway. Just make it part of your headcannon lol.
6. Certain NPC's are missing their heads or aren't converted. How do I fix? <br />
   This happens when you mod existing saves. There are 2 possible solutions. First, save your game. Then open the console, click them (make sure it says NPC), and do resetinventory. If that doesn't work, try using "disable" on them closing the console for them to disappear. Then open console and without clicking anything, do "enable". IF that still doesn't work, then please kindly report it as a bug in my [Discord](https://discord.gg/sqKTwGRwwY)
7. What are Constellation.esm and OldMars.esm in your plugins tab? <br />
   These are pre-order bonuses/dlcs. You can safely ignore
