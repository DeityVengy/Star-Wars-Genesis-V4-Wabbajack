This is a guide on installing the Star Wars Genesis modlist that turns Starfield into Star Wars, as seen on YouTube and featured on IGN.<br />
THIS IS THE BETA VERSION OF V4. IF YOU'RE READING THIS, INSTALL AT YOUR OWN RISK


## **Overview:**<br />
- Complete Sound and Music Overhaul<br />
- Full Conversion of ALL Factions<br />
- Full Conversion of ALL Weapons<br />
- Full Conversion of ALL Spacesuits<br />
- Notable Locations, Planets, and Dialogue Rewritten<br />
- Star Wars Aliens<br />
- Star Wars Misc Items<br />
- Star Wars Signs, Wallpapers, Logos, and other Textures<br />
- Third Person Combat Revamped<br />
- Gameplay Enhancements and Bug Fixes<br />
- Immersive Starting Experience<br />
- 4k Textures<br />
- Realistic Damage, Balancing, and Scaling<br />
- Alternate Start<br />

## **Requirements:**
1. Steam version of Starfield. Alot of these mods have posts about people having issues installing it on the GamePass and MS Store version and some of them straight up aren't compatible. You are completely on your own unfortunately if you choose to go through it knowing this
2. Version 1.12.32 of Starfield. PLEASE TURN OFF AUTOMATIC UPDATES for your sake and don't ever update until a newer version of Star Wars Genesis releases. Bethesda is known for breaking mods in their updates and you may still have issues if you choose to downgrade.
3. DOUBLE CHECK THAT YOU TURNED OFF AUTOMATIC UPDATES FOR STARFIELD
4. Decent Gaming PC. Make sure unmodded Starfield alone runs fine on your PC before attempting these mods. If you're lagging after installing these mods with a budget build, you can disable the HD Overhaul to alleviate it.
5. Not a requirement but I highly recommend doing this on a fresh save for the most immersive and best experience. There will be some mods that won't work on an existing save but you can workaround it by looking at the FAQ.
6. Windows 10/11 (Mod Organizer 2 Limitation)
7. Atleast 50 GB of available space (200+ GB if planning on using HD Overhaul), preferably on an SSD

## **What is Wabbajack?**<br />
Wabbajack is an automated modlist installer. It will replicate my modlist and all it's configurations with a portable version of Mod Organizer 2 on your PC. If you have premium on Nexus Mods, then this process is very easy and in just a few clicks, you can be downloading hundreds of mods at once. If you don't have premium, it's going to have you click through each mod to download but it'll guide you exactly on which one to click but it'll still do all the load order/plugin configuration for you once you're finished. 


## **IMPORTANT PRE-STEPS**   <br />
1. If you've modded Starfield at launch and/or with Vortex Mod Manager, your setup is probably a mess. Please uninstall Starfield completely (delete both Starfield folders in "My Games" and "steamapps\common" folder) and then install it again to delete any remnants of old mods. <br />

## **Manually Installed Mods:**<br />
Please read each mod instruction carefully. They're manually installed in different places. <br />
1. Starfield Script Extender (V0.28) [link](https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/106?tab=files)  <br />
   Drag the contents of sfse_0_2_7 into steamapps\common\Starfield <br />
   Add SFSE to MO2 by following these instructions: [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWVri7somCI&t=85s)
2. Mandalorian Collection Mesh Texture Edits (v2): [link](https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/6043?tab=files)<br />
   Drag the CONTENTS of "Main- Install First" into Documents\My Games\Starfield\ <br />
   DO NOT just drag the actual "Main - Install First" folder inside your Data folder. This is a common mistake.
3. Starfield Hotkeys: [link](https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/1578?tab=files) <br />
   Put into steamapps\common\Starfield. Delete hotkeys.ini
4. Boostpack to Jetpack (A TRUE Jetpack Experience): [link](https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/3800?tab=files)<br />
   I did the Forever Jetpack option but feel free to do any of the other ones. Run enable_hotkeys.cmd after
5. Real ADS - Part 2 - Add Real Zoom: [link](https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/3939?tab=files)<br />
   Open the RealADS_Sniper folder. Drag RealADS.txt into steamapps\common\Starfield
6. Star Wars Mandalorian Title Screen Overhaul [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1xSbbV_F8L1KNOMc0d8S53sihKWz-2bt0?usp=sharing)  <br />
   Install Part 2 Only by putting the Data folder into steamapps\common\Starfield <br />
7. Starfield Performance Boost (All In One (For all)): [link](https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/290?tab=files) <br />
   Drag all the contents into steamapps\common\Starfield.

## **IN-GAME SETUP**<br />
1. If loading an existing save and a pop-up asking about load order appears, make sure you click CURRENT
2. If loading an existing save, you're going to see a popup as soon as you load in about SKK Fast Start and a STOP CODE. Just close it and don't worry about it.
3. If loading a new save, make you you save and restart the game as soon as you load in to fix the sound issue (and numerous other issue)
4. Make sure your difficulty settings are all on normal.
5. For every new jetpack you equip, you must press F1 to activate the jetpack mod. This will unequip your current jetpack so you will have to put the same jetpack on and then press F1 again
   
## **Common Problems and Questions**
1. How do I get X Weapon/Armor?<br />
   Every single thing in this modlist can be acquired ingame through natural progression. If you want to skip that, then download the Star Wars Genesis Encyclopedia in my Discord and find the base game equivalent of the Weapon/Armor you want. Google the ID of that item and spawn it in with console commands.
2. The game is crashing on startup/isn't launching. <br />
   Delete starfield.exe in your steamapps folder and then verify your game files through Steam.
3. Why no lightsabers?<br />
   There are a few lightsaber and jedi/sith mods but it just doesn't really work or feel immersive, especially with this game's poor melee combat. I will add lightsabers when they are ready with proper animations, deflection, and dismemberment. To be fair, the odds of an average person in Star Wars encountering  Jedi/Sith is pretty low anyway. Just make it part of your headcannon lol.
4. Certain NPC's are missing their heads or aren't converted. How do I fix? <br />
   This happens when you mod existing saves. There are 2 possible solutions. Open console, click them, and do resetinventory. If that doesn't work, try using "disable" on them closing the console for them to disappear, and then open console and type enable. Highly recommend saving your game before hand incase you mess something up.
5. Why are some of the mods on Google Drive and not on Nexus Mods? <br />
   Because Nexus Mods is unironically anti-mod. I need permission to modify and update people's files that have been inactive and abandoned for 6+ months. Their mod isn't working anymore. No one is downloading it. No one can contact the original owner. But for some reason I'm not allowed to fix it. I also understandably can't upload any mods with Star Wars music due to copyright, but in reality it's not like Disney would actually care... To be quite honest, I don't really care about any these rules and just want to make a proper Star Wars game/modlist. I allow all my mods be modified and reuploaded freely and I have multiple backups of all files in this modlist so that Star Wars Genesis is never held hostage by deleted mods. I try my best to get permission from every single custom mod I do but there will be cases of miscommunication/disagreement so if any mod author feels that I've stolen their Star Wars asset, feel free to DM me on Discord and we can work things out. If your mod is well-made, I don't mind buying the rights to modify it like I've done with Neocrusaders, Dark Troopers, Yuuzhan Vong, etc.
