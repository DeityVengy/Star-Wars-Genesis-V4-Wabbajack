This is a guide on installing the Star Wars Genesis modlist that turns Starfield into Star Wars, as seen on YouTube and featured on IGN.<br />
THIS IS THE BETA VERSION OF V4. IF YOU'RE READING THIS, INSTALL AT YOUR OWN RISK


## **Overview:**<br />
- Complete Sound and Music Overhaul<br />
- Full Conversion of ALL Factions<br />
- Full Conversion of ALL Weapons<br />
- Full Conversion of ALL Spacesuits<br />
- Notable Locations, Planets, and Dialogue Rewritten<br />
- Alien Races<br />
- Converted Cities & Misc Items<br />
- Aurebesh Wallpapers, Logos, and other Textures<br />
- Third Person Combat Revamped<br />
- Gameplay Enhancements and Bug Fixes<br />
- Immersive Alternate Start Experience<br />
- 4k Textures<br />
- Realistic Damage, Balancing, and Scaling<br />
- Rebalanced Economy <br />

## **Requirements:**
1. Steam version of Starfield. Alot of these mods have posts about people having issues installing it on the GamePass and MS Store version and some of them straight up aren't compatible. You are completely on your own unfortunately if you choose to go through it knowing this
2. Version 1.12.32 of Starfield. PLEASE TURN OFF AUTOMATIC UPDATES for your sake and don't ever update until a newer version of Star Wars Genesis releases. Bethesda is known for breaking mods in their updates and you may still have issues if you choose to downgrade.
3. DOUBLE CHECK THAT YOU TURNED OFF AUTOMATIC UPDATES FOR STARFIELD
4. Decent Gaming PC. Make sure unmodded Starfield alone runs fine on your PC before attempting these mods. If you're lagging after installing these mods with a budget build, you can disable the HD Overhaul to alleviate it.
5. Not a requirement but I highly recommend doing this on a fresh save for the most immersive and best experience. Common issues include existing NPC's keeping their existing armor/weapons, existing planets you've landed on not being revamped, and your health being the wrong value.
6. Windows 10/11 (Mod Organizer 2 Limitation)
7. Atleast 50 GB of available space (200+ GB if planning on using HD Overhaul), preferably on an SSD

## **What is Wabbajack?**<br />
Wabbajack is an automated modlist installer. It will replicate my modlist and all it's configurations with a portable version of Mod Organizer 2 on your PC. If you have premium on Nexus Mods, then this process is very easy and in just a few clicks, you can be downloading hundreds of mods at once. If you don't have premium, it's going to have you click through each mod to download but it'll guide you exactly on which one to click. After that, it'll still do all the load order/plugin configuration for you.


## **IMPORTANT PRE-STEPS**   <br />
1. If you've modded Starfield at launch and/or with Vortex Mod Manager, your setup is probably a mess. Please uninstall Starfield completely (delete both Starfield folders in "My Games" and "steamapps\common" folder) and then install it again to delete any remnants of old mods. <br />

## **Manually Installed Mods:**<br />
Please read each mod instruction carefully. They're manually installed in different places. <br />
1. Starfield Script Extender (V0.29) [link](https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/106?tab=files)  <br />
   Drag the contents of sfse_0_2_9 into steamapps\common\Starfield <br />
   Add SFSE to MO2 by following these instructions: [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWVri7somCI&t=85s)
2. Download Star Wars Genesis - Root Folder Pack from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1j8doGqNVUmXwYbkEDGk4lPTxzOoYCHD-/view?usp=drive_link) and drag all the contents into steamapps\common\Starfield <br />
   If you did this correctly, you should see a popup asking if you want to replace files. If you don't see this popup, then you did something wrong.
   **Run enable_hotkeys.cmd in that same directory**

## **Wabbajack Install**   <br />

1. Download Star Wars Genesis Wabbajack Compiler from here
2. Download and install the latest version of Wabbajack from here
3. Create a folder called Star Wars Genesis in the location where you want to install everything (AWAY FROM WABBAJACK INSTALL LOCATION).
4. When you open Wabbajack for the first time, click the gear icon (settings) on the top left and logon to Nexus Mods
5. In the main menu, choose the "Install From Disk" option
6. Set your target modlist to the Star Wars Genesis Wabbajack Compiler you downloaded earlier
7. Set the "Modlist Installation Location" to the Star Wars Genesis folder you created earlier.

## **Mod Manager Modlist** <br />
**Note: All google drive links are still installed by Mod Organizer 2. Just drag the archive into the downloads section of MO2 and install as you normally would**<br />

<br />**HD Overhaul (OPTIONAL)**<br />
[This](https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/5124?tab=files) amounts to 100+ GB of 2-4K textures and will lead to performance iossues if you have a weak PC. 
1. Download and install all available parts and make sure you name them the correct part number when installing (Ex. Part 1, Part 2, etc)
2. Download and install HD Overhaul Textures Patch
3. Download and install Starfield HD Overhaul ESM

<br />**Sound (IMPORTANT)**<br />
1. Download Star Wars Music and Ambience Overhaul from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YlhFBB024oBvKIl1q7q6oYUZrnuCORoY/view?usp=drive_link) and **replace** the empty mod when installing.

## **Plugin Load Order** <br />
1. Download plugins.txt and put it into Star Wars Genesis\profiles\Star Wars Genesis Compiler
2. In Mod Organizer 2, go to the plugins tab on the right and click this button![image](https://github.com/DeityVengy/Star-Wars-Genesis-V4-Wabbajack/assets/170469610/28a6f6fd-be15-4e60-bf82-5b356ab8ce4d)
3. Choose the top option that comes up

## **IN-GAME SETUP**<br />
**LOADING AN EXISTING SAVE**
1. If a pop-up asking about load order appears, make sure you click CURRENT
2. If a warning pops up saying x plugin is missing, do NOT search for it in the creations menu and CONTINUE loading without it. These are redundant plugins that have been integrated into Star Wars Genesis
3. If you see a popup as soon as you load in about SKK Fast Start and a STOP CODE. Just close it and don't worry about it.
4. Check how much HP your character has. If you're level 1, you should have 100 HP. If you're level 50, you should have around 150 hp, etc. If you're missing HP (for example someone went from v3 to v4 and only had 13 hp), then you must cheat your health back to normal with this command: player.modav health x
   
**STARTING A NEW SAVE**
1. Make you you save and restart the game as soon as you load in to fix the sound issue (and numerous other issue)

**ALL SAVES**
1. Make sure your difficulty settings are all on normal.
2. For every new jetpack you equip, you must press F1 to activate the jetpack mod. This will unequip your current jetpack so you will have to equip the jetpack again and then press F1 again

## **Patch Notes (V3 to V4)**

**General**
- **Wabbajack support**
- Updated StarfieldCustom.ini file with better textures/display config
- KiLoader/Loose Root Data Implementation
- Removed 4 redundant plugins and integrated them into Genesis

**Gameplay**
- Better Weather System for ALL Planets
- Populated planets now have WAY more POI's while barren planets remain the same
- Removed and replaced integalactic loading screens with Hyperspace VFX Transitions
- Gravity Wave converted to proper Force Push
- Star Wars Background and Traits
- Terrifying Terrormorphs Revamp, converting them into Corrupted Rakghouls that inflict allies with Rakghoul plague, turning allies against you and making your character hear voices in their head. Variations include Dread Rakghouls, Phantom Rakghouls, Nightmare Rakghouls, and more.
- Added rare absorbable Kyber Crystals near planet landing areas. Every 3 you absorb gives you 1 skill point
- Added scattered Jedi/Sith Temple Ruins that reward you with unique force powers or status effects
- The Empire and the Rebels are now in active war. You will see them attack each other in Space.

**Spacesuits/Clothing**
- Sith Loyalists have been expanded to have both Purge Trooper and Sith Trooper armor variety. Varu'un Ambassadors have been replaced with Sith Ambassadors
- Shaw Gang renamed to Swoop Gang and given new armor
- Hondo Ohnaka is now The Collector. The Scow is renamed to Ohnaka Gang Base and it's NPCs are Ohnaka Gang members. The unique NPC's are wearing varied Bounty Hunter Armor
- The Shadow Collective has been mixed with the Hondo Ohnaka pirate mod. The grunts have been turned into pirates while the elites and unique NPC's have kept their Mandalorian armor
- "Prototype Sentinel Armor" replacer for new ETES spacesuit given at end of free tracker questline (still needs armor balancing tho)
- Replaced Nar Shaddaa Dancer with Princess Leia Slave Outfits and other Star Wars Aliens. This indirectly causes women wearing swimsuits at Niamos to be topless. Sorry not sorry
- Renamed Coruscant Guard armor on Neon/Nar Shaddaa to Nar Shaddaa armor and added proper armor values to it
- Neo Crusaders no longer wear mixed outfits
- Alien heads no longer clip through miner, nomad, commando, and neocrusader helmets
- Medic Stormtroopers replacing UC Marine Medics

**Overhauls/Conversions**

- Nar Shaddaa Voice Lines
- Sith Code Audio for Artifacts
- Black Galactic Empire flags
- Coruscant City buildings now have lights and follow a day/night cycle
- Nar Shaddaa City has been expanded to be more vertical and larger looking. Weaker PC's may notice an FPS loss
- The Bounty Hunting currency "Astra" is now renamed and re-textured into Beskar
- Added skeletons to destroyed Taris
- Added large Dish above Mast Tower to make it look like Rogue One Citadel Tower

**Balancing**
- Lore Accurate Weapon Change Overhaul
- Darksaber will no longer be used or dropped by normal enemies and instead only by Yuuzhan Vong
- Bullet Sponges have indirectly been fixed due to downgrading Ascension to 1.4.5
- Removed the EM resist that Yuuzhan Vong NPC's naturally had (from Ascension)
- Fixed Shaw Gang bullet sponges and invisible heads
- Patched Ascension's poor weapon accuracy with good accuracy instead
- Continued Renaming Project Development

**Economy**
- 90% cheaper to register ships (this allows you to steal ships, register them, and sell them for profit)
- The Bank Raid (Legacy's End) mission now rewards 1 million credits instead of 250k

**Misc**
- Color corrected dock cutscene
- AU converted to LY (light years)
- Alternate Paradiso (Niamos) Solution
- Buildable Astromech Droids inside ship
- Lt. Torres and Captain Myeong now wear their correct faction's space armor during main quest

**Bug Fixes**
- Essential NPC's is turned back on as it was causing too many issues with quests. Will find a replacement mod in the future.
- Star Wars Datapads text fixed
- Melee attacks and Force Powers no longer get cancelled in third person due to Quick Lowered Weapons
- You no longer flail while falling/using the Jetpack

## **Common Problems and Questions**
1. How do I get X Weapon/Armor?<br />
   Every single thing in this modlist can be acquired ingame through natural progression. If you want to skip that, then download the Star Wars Genesis Encyclopedia in my Discord and find the base game equivalent of the Weapon/Armor you want. Google the ID of that item and spawn it in with console commands. I DO NOT SUPPORT ANYTHING IN THE WORKBENCHES. You are free to use stuff in the workbenches but they are not balanced around Star Wars Genesis and may even be buggy.
2. The game is too hard and I'm getting one shot by everything <br />
   If you're finding the game too hard (especially in the beginning), you can increase your health by 50 or 100 with console commands to make it more doable. The command for that is **player.modav health 100**<br />
   If you're finding the game too easy after leveling up and getting proper armor/weapons, you can revert that change by running this command: **player.modav health -100**
4. The game is crashing on startup/isn't launching. <br />
   Delete starfield.exe in your steamapps folder and then verify your game files through Steam. You will have to reinstall Part 2 of the Title Screen Overhaul again (scroll up)
5. Why no lightsabers?<br />
   There are a few lightsaber and jedi/sith mods but it just doesn't really work or feel immersive, especially with this game's poor melee combat. I will add lightsabers when they are ready with proper animations, deflection, and dismemberment. To be fair, the odds of an average person in Star Wars encountering Jedi/Sith is pretty low anyway. Just make it part of your headcannon lol.
6. Certain NPC's are missing their heads or aren't converted. How do I fix? <br />
   This happens when you mod existing saves. There are 2 possible solutions. First, save your game. Then open the console, click them (make sure it says NPC), and do resetinventory. If that doesn't work, try using "disable" on them closing the console for them to disappear. Then open console and without clicking anything, do "enable". IF that still doesn't work, then please kindly report it as a bug in my [Discord](https://discord.gg/sqKTwGRwwY)
7. What are Constellation.esm and OldMars.esm in your plugins tab? <br />
   These are pre-order bonuses/dlcs. You can safely ignore
8. Why are some of the mods on Google Drive and not on Nexus Mods? <br />
   Because Nexus Mods is unironically anti-mod. I need permission to modify and update people's files that have been inactive and abandoned for 6+ months. Their mod isn't working anymore. No one is downloading it anymore. No one can contact the original owner. But for some reason I'm not allowed to fix it. Also it's absolutely absurd that you can copyright mods that take like 2 minutes to make. It takes longer to upload and post that mod than actually making it. I'm specifically talking about mods that for example change a single value from like 5 to 10 or change the color of an existing ingame outfit from purple to brown. I don't care that you think you have ownership of the idea that you can modify something that already exists within the game lol. I also understandably can't upload any mods with Star Wars music due to copyright, but in reality it's not like Disney would actually care... just like they don't care about the dozen other mods that are still sitting on Nexus that do pretty much the same thing. Basically all it takes is 1 moderator having a bad day to search "Star Wars" and wipe the entire modding scene. So to be quite honest, I don't really care about any these rules and just want to make a proper Star Wars game/modlist. I allow all my mods be modified and re-uploaded freely. I allow this modlist to be re-uploaded and modified freely. I have multiple backups of all files in this modlist so that Star Wars Genesis is never held hostage by deleted mods. At the end of the day, I promise you that the majority of people don't care about stuff like this and just want to play a fun modlist. 
   
_P.S. I try my best to get permission from people that actually created something though. I also don't mind buying the rights to modify or re-upload well made mods like I've done with Neocrusaders and Dark Troopers or straight up commissioning a mod myself like Yuuzhan Vong, etc._
